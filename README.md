Android Composable self-learning Codelab

Mark Donaldson's self-learning of Android programming and development.
Goald:
-Learn current Android development programming frameworks, tools, methods, and best practices for UI/UX and back-end programming
-Don't take this repository too seriously because I'm just playing around learning Android. It has been a few years since I've done
Android programming so that means I'll have to relearn everything I forgot
-Looking to build Quantuity Analytics' first mobile application for their AI smart sensor hardware technology solution for the
commercial trucking industry

Follow my GitHub repository for more shenanigans in hardware, software, and app development as I put in the grind to build and deploy
intelligent IoT solutions on the edge for the commercial trucking industry

If you're looking for a consultant to bring your ideas to life, send me an email or reach out to me on social media and I'll be
happy to book a meeting with you to learn more about your project's requirements to get it build
